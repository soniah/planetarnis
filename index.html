      <div class="content">
<p><span>It was another sunny day over the weekend, and I was lucky that I got off work early. Called over some friends and had them come over to record some videos. We usually do this just to go over some lessons, drills, that we previously learned. </span><br /> <br /> <span>We started off with some basic drills that we usually do and work from there. Then we went on to some basic knife defense. Trying to get the ins and outs, going over those “what ifs” situations. Then went over some hand to hand drills, making them work with the basic drills with sticks. </span><br /> <br /> <span>Then later on, I remembered a drill that we used to do when we started back on those garage days. It was a lock and block drill with two sticks that conveys the similarity of espada y daga (sword and dagger). Usually, we do a basic lock and block drill with only one stick. One feeder and one receiver, one strike at a time, resetting back after each strike. (I’ll probably make a video to have it make more sense)</span><br /> <br /> <span>It inspired me to record a video...

      <h4><a href="http://www.myfma.net/xn/detail/3158179:BlogPost:241152">4 wonderful Babao Arnis Seminars in Las Vegas hosted by CDF &amp; Creative Warrior Academy of LV &amp; Sifu Justin Cataldi</a></h4>
      <div class="entry">
      <div class="content">
<p>Once again I cant begin to express how thankful I am to the Babao family for all their help and support in putting together these Las Vegas seminars twice a year. God willing we will have many more .</p>
<p>      GM Zena Babao , Master Narrison Babao , &amp; Master Jack Babao came out this time , Maestro Kris Babao would also have been there but had a young one get sick in the last minute, for us parents we know how that goes lol .Masters Nar and Jack held a great seminar showing angles 7 through twelve with counters &amp; variations , a really kool way of integrating the angles to a multiple attacker format , and a Baston Form that was fantastic and incorporated all the techniques learned so far. At the end the Babaos had a questions and answers session regarding the terms and info from the seminar with prizes such as sticks and fma eyewear . The seminar participants really enjoyed this part and I must say my students made me really proud when they cleaned up on prizes .</p>
<p>       I always try to host a meal at my house for my adopted Auntie Zena Babao as i just fell in love with her and the Babao family , this time they brought me a very special gift , it was the book written by SGM Ciriaco "Cacoy" Canete called "The Art of Olisi-Baraw" and to my great surprise and delight the Babaos got the SGM to sign it to me, I was just overwhelmed , humbled and honored by this gesture .</p>
<p>GM (Auntie) Zena Babao had also brought a really nice bottle of Saki for my wife and I as we had just gotten married . It was a true blessing to hear some rare stories from Auntie about GM Narrie Babao and GM Inosanto . What an amazing lineage and history the Babaos carry , you know the more Ive learned about the Babaos and FMA the more impressed, amazed and excited I am about this art and culture.</p>
<p>       The day after the seminar I got a text from Master Narrison and he was saying how he loves to practice and was wondering if I would like to train .Of course I jumped at the opportunity to flow with the Master as I know its a great chance for me to learn more of the art . All I can say is Master Nar moves smooth , precise and very impressively . It was an honor indeed to flow with him , and I feel blessed for the time with him .</p>
<p>       This was our fourth seminar with the Babao Family , the first one started with the arrival of GM Narrie Babao in LV , which was setup by my teacher , Guro Richard Lamoureaux and Master Lindsey Largusa . Shortly after this meeting sadly and in such a untimely manner we lost a great Master when Master Largusa passed on to the heavens to train Kali in peace .</p>
<p>       Now Guro Rich and GM Babao are more determined to put together more FMA events in las vegas and GM Babao held the first Babao Arnis seminar in Las Vegas , He taught a most informative and fun seminar and had a charisma about him that kept the whole group laughing and training the whole time .He told me I moved well because I was with Guro Rich and told me he was a great teacher , I think he took a liking to me and gave me some great advice and technique that I will cherish forever .</p>
<p>       We went out to lunch afterwards and said our goodbyes , I had no Idea this would be the last time I got to see Gm Narrie Babao as he passed just as sadly and untimely ( and quickly ) as Master Largusa , I was shocked !</p>
<p>      GM Zena Babao and son Master Narrison Babao who has taken the lead in sharing his fathers wonderful legacy with the world with his brothers Master Jack and Maestro Kris at his side , continued to come to Vegas to to seminars with us as it is very important to them to carry on their fathers legacy and vision .</p>
<p>      The second seminar was instructed by Master Nar who gave us more detail in Babao Arnis and the first 6 angles and counters , accompanied by sinawali training and Master Mike Gomez who showed me some great knife applications and traps , and the third seminar was Instructed by Master Nar , Mastro Kris who detailed and added to our Babao Arnis and a very special guest to show some Eskrido , was GM Ted Sotelo who did a great demo in which I was fortunate enough to assist him with . </p>
<p>     Ive studied various arts over the years accomplishing a 3rd degree black sash in Tibetan Lama Kung Fu and Tai Chi under Sifu Jack Soderberg who is certified by world famous Kung Fu Master , GM Wai Lun Choi , I also spent a great deal of time training in Brazilian Jiu Jitsu and kickboxing and have achieved a blue belt in BJJ under Dave Howard who is certified under legendary John Lewis .</p>
<p>    When I got into Kali / JKD with my Guro Rich who is under GM Inosanto , Guro Ted Lucay Jr. and Guro Paul Vunak , to name a few lol , my mind changed forever . FMA changed the way i train ALL my arts , how I view ranges , empty hands , weapons and footworks . How I teach martial arts , how I train MMA and when I met GM Babao he really gave me a beautiful perspective that changed me again . I know hes in the Heavens training with the other GMs and laughing that awsome laugh that would make you smile .</p>
<p>      As I look back on my training and the teachers who have come into my life I know it was all part of Gods plan , I feel truly blessed and thankful for Filipino Martial Arts <a href="http://api.ning.com:80/files/KWPY3KRntMziBq73Sv*e5e4vov5L2GTCeEEDxX90M7IbuTld*JH4fosRjVwnw74X8lon*y-zzpeadv7PhfBgDcwp2ili3BIT/195.JPG" target="_self"><img class="align-full" src="http://api.ning.com:80/files/KWPY3KRntMziBq73Sv*e5e4vov5L2GTCeEEDxX90M7IbuTld*JH4fosRjVwnw74X8lon*y-zzpeadv7PhfBgDcwp2ili3BIT/195.JPG?width=750" width="750" /></a><a href="http://api.ning.com:80/files/KWPY3KRntMwvIdwlz74G355k8F7loc6ZgPiqLoNj0dbpmV5SbrEDJTVAOZrftJttfzqS*ysTwkNcyZRqLBH36PGbk7HumasC/007.JPG" target="_self"><img class="align-full" src="http://api.ning.com:80/files/KWPY3KRntMwvIdwlz74G355k8F7loc6ZgPiqLoNj0dbpmV5SbrEDJTVAOZrftJttfzqS*ysTwkNcyZRqLBH36PGbk7HumasC/007.JPG?width=750" width="750" /></a><a href="http://api.ning.com:80/files/KWPY3KRntMyVyDd6mdPSuYrhtbR-VuO1fBNww*MiFnGHMNBYR-hmeoaEgZZ3fwnC4uMYyaDQpn-MZU1iNVv26F8oNmx6jjHZ/002.JPG" target="_self"><img class="align-full" src="http://api.ning.com:80/files/KWPY3KRntMyVyDd6mdPSuYrhtbR-VuO1fBNww*MiFnGHMNBYR-hmeoaEgZZ3fwnC4uMYyaDQpn-MZU1iNVv26F8oNmx6jjHZ/002.JPG?width=750" width="750" /></a><a href="http://api.ning.com:80/files/KWPY3KRntMydGNv03dWNd376PmRXlKxKHnY6cF4h*RlNwRQV2X9fhlLKoR6T3WcGvuKdz3OkUnuk0Lhg9TbF-Vum-Xu8qfIV/136.JPG" target="_self"><br /></a></p>

      <div class="entry">
      <div class="content" lang="en">
<p>“Fear is the mind-killer.” This is a quote from one of my favorite novels of all time. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dune_%28novel%29" target="_blank">Dune</a> by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Herbert" target="_blank">Frank Herbert</a> is a science fiction novel that is celebrating it’s 50th anniversary this year. I love it because it is a highly philosophical text that deals with environmentalism, feudal society, and religion in a palatable, understandable story. But the simple declarative sentence that fear is the main obstacle we face has always stuck with me. The quote is powerful; it is motivational. It is also wrong. Fear is a good thing. Everyone has fears; it’s healthy and keeps us alive. The sentiment of the quote still works for me, but I would edit it to replace fear with negativity. Negativity is the mind-killer. Negativity, not fear, is the biggest detriment to attempting anything new.</p>
<div class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 970px;"><a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/GetMotivated/related/11cdz9/fear_is_the_mindkiller_xpost_from_scifi/"><img alt="" height="720" src="https://i1.wp.com/i.imgur.com/HMNlA.png" width="960" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">The entire quote is shown above. Try it out, replace the first ‘fear’ with ‘be negative’ and the others with ‘negativity.’</p></div>
<p>Fear is an evolutionary response to keep us safe. Why are we afraid of the foaming, barking dog? Because rabies is bad for our health. Why are we afraid of running red lights? Because we could be hit by oncoming traffic. But as it is part of being a human, it is not a perfect process. We are constantly overcoming fear to enjoy life. Fear is a factor in the risk portion of the risk/reward calculus that governs our everyday existence. We typically divide fears into rational, irrational, and chemical imbalances. For this article, let’s stick strictly in the realm of rational and irrational. For me, the difference between rational and irrational fears usually comes down to negativity. I shy away from something because I’m sure it won’t work out. I’m sure the outcome will be negative.</p>
<p><a href="https://mentalinfusion.wordpress.com/2014/03/25/trying-to-fight-negativity/"><img alt="" class="aligncenter" src="https://mentalinfusion.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/it-wont-work.gif?w=500" /></a>For example, my first <a href="http://www.tacticalmartialarts.com/" target="_blank">Counterpoint Tactical System</a> belt test was at <a href="https://stlcounterpoint.wordpress.com/2014/11/13/2014-iron-mountain-overview/" target="_blank">Iron Mountain camp</a> in 2010. I stood in front of forty or so strangers with other blue belt candidates that I had met for the first time the day before. I was nervous. I was afraid of failure. Was this fear rational? Yes, it was entirely possible that I was not prepared enough to move onto the next part of the curriculum. I was afraid of being embarrassed. Was this fear rational? No. No. Absolutely not. The fear of embarrassment is based on the assumption that others will view us negatively. In the case of fear of failure, a clearly defined condition for success and failure was available, and it was defined externally to me. (Though I believe no one actually fails a test if they learned something from it.) The fear of embarrassment was internally imposed by me, and on top of that, it was in direct opposition of the evidence of my time at the camp. The people I met were generous and kind. They were supportive in helping me prepare; so, why would they view me any differently? This fear was irrational because of those factors. One fear is driven by standards, and the other was driven by negativity.</p>
<div class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 710px;"><a href="http://www.quotehd.com/quotes/author/dale-carnegie-writer"><img alt="" height="700" src="https://i1.wp.com/www.quotehd.com/imagequotes/authors2/dale-carnegie-writer-quote-first-ask-yourself-what-is-the-worst-that.jpg" width="700" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Some of the best advice I’ve ever received.</p></div>
<p>Negativity is our true enemy. Negativity is the voice that tells us we’ll fail before we even begin. Negativity is thinking that they’re all gonna laugh at me. It is a mindset that is imposed internally. This mindset is brought about by how we talk to ourselves. We all seem to know that our mind listens to what we say, but do we really understand what that means? Our brains pay attention to what we say, and when we say something enough, we believe it. If I make a mistake, there is a world of difference between saying, “Well, that was dumb” and “Well, I’m dumb.” One describes a moment in the past or an action. The other statement describes me in an on-going manner. The good thing is that words matter. We can use words to combat negativity. The quote above from Dale Carnegie is the best process for fighting negativity and fear that I have yet come across. Asking yourself what’s the worst that could happen is necessary but only partially correct. Accepting that outcome takes control back from the fear. You are not a bystander but an active participant. Then you can get to work on improving your position from that outcome.</p>

<p>To continue with my example from Iron Mountain, I asked myself what is the worst that could happen. Well, the worst that could happen is that I fail the test. This was easiest to accept. Progress requires risk. The worst that could happen would mean taking the test again in the future. Accepting that meant more training time with my friend. The worst that could happen is that everyone laughs at my failure, but so what? Accepting that outcome became easy because it meant the group wasn’t one that I could be a part of. Hopefully, you see that by saying these thoughts, the rational fears seem reasonable, and the irrational one presents itself quickly. If people who didn’t pass their test were laughed out of the system, then there wouldn’t have been as large a crowd testing at camp or even at camp itself. It was negative thoughts about the others that created the fear, not any actions or comments from the actual campers. The process of continually asking yourself what is the worst possible outcome and can you live with it makes fear and negativity easier to deal with. It frames the rational fears in terms of consequences and shines the lights on irrational fears.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/STLCounterpoint"><img alt="Fear 02" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1995" height="665" src="https://stlcounterpoint.files.wordpress.com/2015/06/fear-02.jpg?w=500&amp;h=665" width="500" /></a>Next time you are hesitating, ask yourself if it’s fear that is holding you back or is it negativity? When you hesitate ask yourself, what’s the worst that could happen? Explicitly list the worst. It will shine a light on what is rational and irrational. Even list things that you may not believe. Like in my example of listing that I could get laughed at. I knew that wouldn’t happen, and I listed it anyway. The act of saying it showed how ridiculous it was. Exposing the irrational fear removed unnecessary stress. During the test, I was able to focus on the skills that I had. The fear of failure brought out my best performance up to that time. By removing the negativity, fear became a motivator.</p><br />  <a href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/stlcounterpoint.wordpress.com/1992/" rel="nofollow"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/stlcounterpoint.wordpress.com/1992/" /></a> <a href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/godelicious/stlcounterpoint.wordpress.com/1992/" rel="nofollow"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/delicious/stlcounterpoint.wordpress.com/1992/" /></a> <a href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gofacebook/stlcounterpoint.wordpress.com/1992/" rel="nofollow"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/facebook/stlcounterpoint.wordpress.com/1992/" /></a> <a href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gotwitter/stlcounterpoint.wordpress.com/1992/" rel="nofollow"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/twitter/stlcounterpoint.wordpress.com/1992/" /></a> <a href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gostumble/stlcounterpoint.wordpress.com/1992/" rel="nofollow"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/stumble/stlcounterpoint.wordpress.com/1992/" /></a> <a href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/godigg/stlcounterpoint.wordpress.com/1992/" rel="nofollow"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/digg/stlcounterpoint.wordpress.com/1992/" /></a> <a href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/goreddit/stlcounterpoint.wordpress.com/1992/" rel="nofollow"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/reddit/stlcounterpoint.wordpress.com/1992/" /></a> <img alt="" border="0" height="1" src="https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=stlcounterpoint.wordpress.com&amp;blog=38967803&amp;post=1992&amp;subd=stlcounterpoint&amp;ref=&amp;feed=1" width="1" />      </div>

      <div class="entry">
      <div class="content" lang="en">
<p>Some feelings might get hurt on this one.</p>
<p>I decided to tag the four systems in the title of this article (Presas, meaning Remy as well as his brother Ernesto) for a reason:  I know people on several sides of the debates in these systems and have some insight. Because I am not a player in these situations, I decided to classify this article as an “Observation/Insight”, so that no one can shake the “mind-your-own-business” finger at me. It is, however, a little more than an opinion piece. My view of these situations are rooted in the cultures I was raised in from my own grandfather and his martial arts philosophy, my Jow Ga kung fu teacher, and a few others. So I am speaking as one who has my own lineage of martial arts, and understands the philosophy and culture of the arts quite well.</p>
<p>I happen to know several grandmasters of the same system. Is that confusing? The phrase <em>several grandmasters of the same system</em> can confuse a few of us, depending on your definition of “Grandmaster”:</p>
<ul>
<li>The founder of a new system of fighting</li>
<li>The oldest, senior, or highest ranking master of a system</li>
<li>Your teacher’s teacher–your martial arts grandfather, if you will</li>
<li>A level of rank in a system</li>
<li>The oldest, senior, or highest ranking master of a system in a geographic area</li>
<li>A title one is bestowed by the community or given to onesself</li>
</ul>
<p>So, which one is valid?</p>
<p>Surely, you jest. Martial arts systems and corporate cultures are as varied as fingerprints in this community. How dare any of us use our own as a standard to judge another man’s culture and practices by? As martial artists, we should be respectful of all. There is room for all of us in this martial culture, and the only walk of life, the only title that really matters, is the one called “Better-than-me”. In this industry, unlike most, every man practicing their art is endeavoring to become more knowledgeable and skilled than every other man calling himself a martial artist. I respect almost all martial artists. However, I do not respect the martial artist who cannot beat me–and does not strive to build his skill until he can beat me. In my opinion, any martial artist who is not training to beat the next guy needs to get out of the business. The business of martial arts has many different angles and specialties–and all of them are involved with self-improvement and self-preseveration.</p>
<p>And despite what you may believe of the martial arts, it actually <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em>is</em></span> about fighting, and the bottom line of martial arts styles is “Can you beat me? Or can I beat you?”</p>
<p>We must toughen our bodies, toughen our minds, toughen our emotions, and strengthen our character. One way that we can do such a thing is to become better men, not just better businessmen and better showmen. Fighting, in this part of the conversation, is irrelevent. When I say that we should become better men, I am referring to a man who is:</p>
<ul>
<li>Truthful</li>
<li>Reliable/Keeps his word</li>
<li>In pursuit of self-improvement</li>
<li>Selfless</li>
<li>Kind</li>
<li>Righteous</li>
<li>Courageous</li>
<li>Empathetic</li>
</ul>
<p>In An-Nawawi’s Forty Hadith, he relates that the Prophet Muhammad (saw) stated that no one is a true believer unless he wants for his brother, what he wants for himself. In other words, a man who is striving for improvement is not a good man, unless he is also striving for his brothers to improve as well. When we apply this wisdom to the martial arts, it is not enough for me as an FMA man to strive to become the best if my skill does not help other FMA men become good as well. If you are a Master or leader in a particular martial arts system, training to become the BEST teacher of that system is good. But it is better if your improved knowledge and skill also benefit the other teachers of your system. I am not suggesting you take your valuable research in the art and share it with the world. On the contrary, you should actually keep those secrets secret. But if you withold that information from your own system brothers, can you actually call yourself a leader of the system? Are you in fact promoting the system if others in your system do not benefit from your research–or are you just promoting yourself?</p>
<p>If a martial arts system’s leader is on the right path, he is not a divider, but a uniter. He does not look to separate himself from his system brothers. Sure, he can have his own school, maybe even his own identity <em>as a member of that martial arts family</em>. But in order to be an effective Master/Grandmaster of that system, he must be looking for a way to bring his wisdom to the rest of the family even if it is only through associating themselves with his work. Martial arts styles are brands. Their uniqueness are trade secrets. You cannot have more CEOs than workers, and some will have to be satisfied promoting the interests of the system as a lower level manager, as a third and fourth man in charge, even as a foot soldier. If everyone in the system is preoccupied with trying to be the admiral and no one wants to man the boiler room, the ship will surely sink. The first step in determining if you have what it takes to be a Grandmaster is first finding out if you love the system more than you love your position in it. You must want this art to become bigger than you, and you cannot love money, recognition, power and influence, or yourself more than your desire to see the art outlive you. And you must be willing to allow a better man to lead, even if he is less skilled, has less time-in-grade or lower ranking than you. Not everyone is qualified to sit in the captain’s chair.</p>
<p>When your grandmasters taught you, they didn’t always communicate their desires for who would be in charge when they passed away. Sometimes, Masters were more focused on teaching. Sometimes, they were more focused on developing a particular student. Sometimes, they intended for the senior/ranking position to go the senior student, his son or daughter, the best fighter, the best businessman, or a favorite student. You won’t always like or understand that decision. The question is, do you want the system to go on–or are you that disgruntled with your Grandmaster that you no longer wish to be affiliated? If you decide to leave and break ties, there is nothing wrong with that. Just don’t drop your Grandmaster’s name to establish your credibility. One great Master of our time, the great Mas Oyama, did just that. He broke away, established his own and actually improved better than even his own masters. And when those masters died, Oyama did not go back to Japan to claim leadership of his master’s systems. He moved on.</p>
<p>Many masters leave behind their legacy to a student who was disliked by his peers. Perhaps that student was not the best fighter, but was a good PR man. Maybe he was a junior student who spent most of his time with the Master in his last days. But when that Master is dead and gone, every student who loved him and loved his system should not discredit one another–especially when concerning leadership or “Grandmastership”. It’s silly. You all want to be Grandmasters? Then so be it. But don’t put down the next guy, especially if you know he put in his time just like you did, and wants to see the system grow–just like you, just like your teacher.</p>
<p>Inheritors of a system are gatekeepers to that system. Many of us are inheritors by birthright. Manong Leo Giron’s son, Michael Giron is such a person. Grandmaster Angel Cabales’ son Vincent Cabales is such a person. GM Ernesto Presas has Jan Jan, GM Remy has Dr. Presas Jr. But other gatekeepers of the same systems are the highest ranking, active students–in Bahala Na’s case, Antonio Somera. In others, a member of the newest generation of students who is outranked by everyone older than him–for example, in Remy Presas’ Modern Arnis it was a group of students he called his MOTT (Masters of Tapi Tapi). Another gatekeeper can be the best of the group, the most active of the group, the ones closest to him before he died. Another one may be the student who keeps the Master’s original organization going after he died, and then after <a href="http://www.bahalana.org/instructors/grand-master-tony-somera">his successor</a> died–like (and he doesn’t call himself Grandmaster, but I’m calling him GM) Joel Juanitas. The system’s members may not call a man Grandmaster, a man may not call himself Grandmaster, but from the strength of his own skill and that of his students may thrust a Master into that leadership role, like Grandmaster-who-doesn’t-use-the title-Grandmaster Darren Tibon. There are masters who left to found there own organizations who come back after certain deaths to stake claims. Other Masters who were around in non-leadership roles, but decided after some time to assume (sometimes by asserting themselves) leadership/Grandmaster roles. And then you have masters who stayed out of the limelight, but get up on stage after being unhappy with the way current leadership is handling business. There is a place for you too, guys. Just don’t try to push anyone off the stage while you’re doing it.</p>
<p>I get it. I am not one who cares to sit in the driver’s seat. In my Jow Ga system, I was the guy who spent the most time in my Master’s presence during his last years on Earth. I learned his personal stuggles, learned things about the system he had not shown other students. But I was the youngest member of the “Sifu” class. I will never be the “Grandmaster” of US Jow Ga. I even stopped teaching Jow Ga for two decades and got back in the spotlight when I saw some things I disliked. With the exception of one Sifu/”Grandmaster” of Jow Ga, you will never hear me discredit any Jow Ga Sifu, and I am satisfied leading from a few rows back. But I love that Kung Fu system like a family member, and this is why I don’t hurt the art or anyone else in pursuit of my goals. You cannot lead a system unless you love your art’s longevity more than you love your own legacy within it.</p>
<p>Like I said, I understand everyone’s position. I didn’t meet my paternal grandfather until I was 11. Only a few years later, I returned to the Philippines until I was an adult, then I came back to the U.S. and enlisted in the service. When I found myself back in DC, he was sick, and I took care of him daily until he died two years later. In his last days, he shared many stories. He gave me memorabilia from his life, gave me names to look up, told me things about my own father that perhaps my Dad might not know. And guess what? The day after my grandfather died, I became the gatekeeper–keeping out cousins who came over to claim Grandaddy’s favorite watch, pictures, suits, his cars. My emotions were out of control. Where were you when Grandpa couldn’t bathe himself? Did you know where he went to high school? Well I have his diploma. Tell me what his favorite meals were.</p>
<p>But I was foolish. Each of my cousins had a separate relationship with my Grandfather. They had their own stories to tell, their own memories, and each of my cousins felt just as connected to him and his lineage as I did. I became close to him in his last two years, but they had decades. I fancied myself his closest and youngest grandson–but to them, I was the foreign grandson with the accent who ate balut. Here we were, thinking that we knew this man better than the other, that we loved him more. This family would have been ripped apart if we did not recognize and respect the other’s own–perhaps selfish–claim to his memory.</p>
<p>To an outsider it may seem strange that a system would have many Grandmasters. Is the true leader of Manong Leo’s Bahala Na Dexter Labonog? Michael Giron? Joel Juanitas?  What about Master Kirk McCune?  Is the Serrada King Cabales or Tibon? This is a valid argument for many, but the truth is that it is one that will never be resolved. The world is big, the FMA world is big. Serrada is in competition with Bahala Na, just as it had been for half a century, and those two arts are in competition with Modern Arnis, Kombatan, even with my own Gatdula Fighting Eskrima. If you get focused too much on the leadership argument, other systems will pass you by. As the adage goes, five fingers make a hand, but if you ball them up tight into a fist, you can strike a mighty blow. With each grandmaster working closely together, they can make water cut a diamond. But working apart, a system can disappear as easily as a mist. Once you recognize everyone’s claim, a system can become even stronger than it was when the Grandmaster walked the Earth.</p>

      <div class="entry">
      <div class="content" lang="en">
<p>This message is just as much for my own student-Instructors, as it is for my readers. It is a continuation of <a href="http://filipinofightingsecretslive.com/2015/01/28/straw-vs-waterhoses/" target="_blank">this article, entitled “Straw vs. Waterhoses”</a>. When you get a chance, check it out.</p>
<p>An important vitrue in learning the martial arts is, of course, patience. What few know is that patience is equally vital to the transmission of an art for teachers–if not <em>more</em> important. I am no fan of the “waterhose” philosophy to learning and teaching. Rather than drink from an excessively fast flow of information (like a waterhose)–you increase the value and impact of your learning by sipping through a straw. Don’t let most of your learning waste onto the ground because you were unable to retain it all; sip in periodic, ingestible amounts. Drink, absorb, enjoy. Drink, absorb, enjoy. Wash, rinse, repeat.  Do not drink more until you have fully absorbed what you’ve taken in or you’ll just piss it all way. Take your time; the knowledge won’t go away if you’re dedicated and diligent. Better that you know what you know thoroughly and fully, than know what you know barely and can’t do anything more than regurgitate it and spit it out for others to “not-ingest-completely-either”. This is how martial arts gets watered down.</p>
<p>Studying the martial arts and testing for instructorship can be a lot like the difference between a guy who studies and reads all semester long, a few hours a night for the entire term. When the final exam is given, he is confident. He can relax and watch TV the night before–all of his lessons are burned into his memory. He can apply his knowledge in almost any situtation he finds himself in. There is no jumbled, classical mess in his brain. He understands concepts as fluently as he understands his first language. When the questions are asked, he immediately has access to the answers.</p>
<p>On the other hand, we have the student who did not study and read all semester. We don’t know what he was doing–perhaps reading material from other subjects, skipping ahead into next semester’s curriculum, or just pretending to be a diligent student while looking for a shortcut. Speaking of which–in the few days prior to the final exam, he burns the midnight oil, and crams all the lessons from the entire semester into as many hours he can in a few days. He does this with flash cards, word association memorization techniques, notes scribbled on his hands, visualization–whatever he needs to. The day of the exam, he has memorized the material and can answer any question if you give him a second. During the exam, each question gets answered after he searches his memory for the answer. And guess what? He also passes the exam.</p>
<p>The difference is not just how the second student was able to memorize the same amount of material in 10% of the time. After all, did they both pass the exam? If “passing” is all that mattered to you, then this discussion ends here. The big question is, did both men actually <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em>learn</em></span> the same material? Perhaps years later, the student who crammed can still recite his lessons just as well as one can recite lyrics to a poem. The second difference between both students is that one memorized and the other learned. Learning, my martial arts brothers and sisters, is not the simple hands and feet “reciting” the lessons. It is not in the ability to recall the material and memorizing terms and definitions. “Learning” is in the application. You can “learn” 500 vocabulary words of a foreign language and still do not “speak” that language. You can understand how to conjugate a verb, phonetically pronounce those words in the perfect accent, know male and female nouns… and a three year old child who is a native speaker of that language with 300 words can “speak” and communicate better than you. You have memorized words, phrases and rules of grammar, but the child with a more limited vocabulary speaks this language better than you do. And this is why the Jujitsu Blue Belt student with three years of training can destroy the seminar-certified Black Belt teacher who “knows” the entire curriculum. One has memorized moves while the other <span style="text-decoration: underline;">understands</span> the moves.</p>
<p>As teachers, we are responsible for the quality of learning that our students experience in our tutelage. If we are impatient in getting them through the curriculum, for whatever reason, the students will know the curriculum without really <em>knowing</em> it. Students must be given material slowly enough to fully grasp it, absorb it, and to think of combat and self defense as though those techniques are the only options he has. Exhaust all the possibility of a technique and its variations before moving on to the next. This is why students choke when fighting and sparring. Too often, a martial arts student can recall counters and defenses, but none come to him naturally and as a reflexive response. The main reason is that we have given the student more in his tool box than his thinking will allow him to use naturally.</p>
<p>Sometimes, we worry about retention, so we rush the student to the next level so they don’t become discouraged or bored. But what will discourage more–not progressing as quickly as he’d like? Or losing a fight because his Black Belt wasn’t really earned?</p>
<p>My grandfather was still teaching me techniques when he died. I was his last student, and one of only three grandchildren who taught since most of my cousins chose other careers and my uncles all died. There was a short period before he passed where I learned quickly before it was too late, and that information is not a part of my curriculum. My grandfather was prepared to let that information go, but I insisted on learning it. I recently began teaching it to my son, and I see the value that I missed because I never absorbed it. My grandpather was 78 teaching it to me, I am 45 and teaching it to my 15 year old boy. Seeing that rushed learning being practiced and absorbed slowly has given me a new appreciation for it.</p>
<p>Must admit though, that I have a selfish reason for promoting this theory:  In learning and developing something slowly, you will be less inclined to just give it away for 100 bucks. As one who reveres the Filipino art, I hate to see our systems sold off in seminars and video. I value this art as I do a family heirloom. Some see the art as a commodity to generate income. When teachers take their time while imparting the art, you allow your students to learn and develop properly and their skill will be three times the skill of one who crashed coursed. Better for all FMA people.</p>
<p>In many systems there are 6, 8, 10, 12, 24, 48, 64 strikes. Regardless of how many, those techniques should be taught only a few at a time. Allow your students to see fighting as if only those few strikes exist. They will see those few strikes as the only options in combat and will mentally fit them in to all situations. Give them plenty of time to experiment with them, develop them into instant weapons when the time comes. When the students have those techniques in their arsenal as second nature–give them a little more. This is teaching patiently. A student with weak wrists and poor coordination will not make good use of half your curriculum. Develop them as they learn. Many teachers are just teaching them. As the proverb goes–do not cast your pearls to swine.</p>
<p>And withold your techniques for those who are really ready for it.</p>

      <div class="entry">
      <div class="content" lang="en">
<p>It is no secret, that I am the anti-FMA Grandmaster. I respect them. But I disagree with most of them when concerning teaching the art. The proof is in the pudding, and I support my side of the debate with my claim that I will bet my house on ANY of my instructor level students against ANY of theirs.</p>
<p>Sadly, most Grandmasters would never take such a bet, and most of them can’t even <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em>name</em></span> all of their instructor level students. This is not a judgment against teachers with a lot of students. But it is a judgment against the teaching format most of the Grandmasters (and most likely, yours too) use to impart this art. I can understand, that many good teachers have taught so many students that they cannot remember everyone’s name. I have only been teaching for 28 years, and I can’t name all my students, and the largest my enrollment has ever been was 175.</p>
<p>The act of teaching a student from the beginner level through a high level of proficiency is a very intimate one. It is not a business transaction. The way many FMA students are taught are very impersonal. Teachers know nothing about you. Often, they don’t even meet you–especially if the lessons were via distance learning (aka “DVD”). In a seminar, the most contact one might have with a teacher is the occasional correction he might do (that is, if he actually does the correcting instead of one of his helpers), or at the end of the session, when handing out certificates, shaking hands and taking pictures. This is not how one guarantees the skill level of someone you’re teaching. It is a method of imparting the art to the masses, spreading the name of the system–which is supposed to be good for the FMAs in general (if you believe mass marketing is in fact the answer). I strongly disagree. And unlike most guys stating their opinion, I will prove my point in person.</p>
<p>One of the teaching concepts I disagree with is the idea of “Drinking out of a waterhose”, often associated with GM Dan Inosanto. It goes like this:  You have a large group of students of varied levels and experience in one room. You need a way to give the bare-bones beginner something to take home, as well as the Guro-student who is already teaching. How to accomplish this? Without teaching over the heads of the beginner while not boring the advanced guy?</p>
<p>The answer:  You give them so much technique in that session and students take away as much as they remember. You pour it out fast, give multiple variations, concepts, what-if exchanges and updated changes to the stuff they learned last time they came. Those who can drink fast, retain more. Those who cannot, retain what they can. Hmmph. Well, thank God for camcorders and cell phones. At the end of every seminar, there should be at least two or three breaks where the GM dazzles them with a display of choreographed give and take/counter demonstrations, along with the “you-can-do-dis-you-can-do-dat” with a Filipino accent. Ooooo…. Ahhhhh….. How authentic. Makes you feel like a Mindanao warrior. lol</p>
<p>But real skill in the art is not learned this way. Doesn’t matter how much you practice after the seminar is over and the Grandmaster flies home. It shouldn’t even be taught this way. Martial arts is not taught like how academics is taught in the lecture halls–it should be taught like the breakout groups with the professor’s assistants through the week. (Hey I never said I didn’t go to college)  The study groups, where the basics are drilled and questions are asked, and two or three days a week, the same material is introduced and reintroduced, questioned, analyzed and dissected &lt;—- this is where the learning occurs. If you got a hodgepodge of information one week in a session, then often unrelated stuff a few months from now (or worse–next year), you’ll never learn. This is not a cohesive, intensive study of a subject. Instead, it is an introduction that comes in small, barely digested bites. You can’t learn a language in a seminar a few times a year, and you certainly can’t learn a fighting art that will one day save your life on the street this way either.</p>
<p>When teaching, I believe in the immersion method. You come back week after week, drill the same few techniques over and over, hundreds of repetitions per session, thousands of repetitions per month, for years. You live, eat, breathe the art–in the presence of the Master. You sit at his feet for hours at a time to learn what he has to impart with no time constraints. You don’t have many students to compete against for his attention. He learns you like a mentor learns his pupil, like a doctor learns his patient… like a parent learns his child. Your student learns your favorite meals, he knows how you got almost every injury you have, know the origin of the scars on your face and who gave it to you. You know his financial issues, you’ve talked about his marital woes, his fears while walking on the street. You know his habits when he fights, what he’s good at, what he isn’t good at, how he will be beaten, what he specializes in when he is fighting. Your student’s skill is a constant work in progress, like a tree stump you whittle on daily for years, until it looks like a perfect replica of whatever was in your mind. Every mistake he made in fighting, you’ve already erased. Things he can’t do are no longer an issue, because you’ve taught him how to overcome it. I have students who aren’t perfect fighters, but I have taught them how to work around those imperfections. And when I was confident that they will dominate whoever is in front of them, I considered them advanced enough to teach.</p>
<p>This ^^^ my friends, is how you “certify” a Guro. Not through some crash or correspondence course where you wouldn’t bet your reputation on them if asked. Trust me, I’ve heard all the excuses:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>What about the guys who live out of town?</strong>  They need to relocate, travel or find another teacher. You can’t have them all</li>
<li><strong>What about the guys whose careers don’t allow them to study full time?</strong>  They are not viable candidates to be a martial arts teacher. I am a doctor, but I want to be a lawyer too. Yeah, well I’d like to be a millionaire. Get out my face with that–make a decision</li>
<li><strong>The art needs to be spread to as many people as possible.</strong>  Says who? McGuro? Next!</li>
<li><strong>Not everyone wants to be a great fighter.</strong> Then they need to find another occupation</li>
</ul>
<p>Little Mikey wants to be a doctor, but he has neither the grades to get into medical school, the discipline to finish a program, or lives in a city with a medical school. So what should he do? Well, there are laws against him calling himself a doctor. Unless he is willing to improve his grades, work hard for it, or relocate to a city that has a medical school (and get accepted)–he honestly <em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">doesn’t want to be a doctor</span></em>. I would question any asshole who taps him on the shoulder and finds a way for him to become a “certified” Doctor without doing it the way everyone else did it. Most of your grandmasters have done this with the Filipino Martial Arts.</p>
<p>This is one of the main reasons thekuntawman exists, and why many people dislike me–because I won’t shut up about it. And this is the driving force behind most of the articles on this blog; the Filipino martial arts has become a mass-marketed commodity. It is no longer the deadly fighting art it claims to be, and so many Grandmasters are the reason why.</p>
<p>Martial arts technique is not meant to be drunk through a waterhose, but to be sipped through a drinking straw. It must be absorbed in fully; not to have most of it wasted down your chin. I have 8 leg attacks in my system, and I never teach more than one or two at a time. Students are here to learn completely and absorb my system, not to have me show them something they could memorize and demonstrate to youtube. When they fight, I expect everything in their arsenal to be a knee-jerk reaction or deliberate use of technique in live time. You can’t do this when more is thrown at them than can become a part of their thought process. I believe in this system of teaching, and this is the reason I will always put my guys out as proof of it–and why most “masters” won’t.</p>

      <h4><a href="http://arnisescrimakali.tumblr.com/post/76545357629">Blind Sensei Love</a></h4>
      <div class="entry">
      <div class="content">
<p>Let’s get it straight. We live in a capitalist society, and you’re paying for a service when you sign up for martial arts lessons. But in any other service you’d be looking for quality results- modern martial artists have developed some freaky stockholme syndrome to their teachers. Instead of being critical of the services they pay for, students have developed some sort of blind love for sensei. In doing this, students who normally are owed services for their payment, often feel like they owe their teachers for all they taught, and all they gave back was loving devotion, forgetting the monthly fees entirely.</p>
<p>Let’s go back in time- there was once a Filipino Martial Artist. He had never finished high school (though if I recall correctly, he left school very, very, early), and was working as a chef. Normally, he would have spent his life in poverty, but as luck would have it, he found a student who paid for the teacher’s way out of the country.</p>
<p>For years, this student had become the “number one student” of this martial artist, until the day when a sponsor came and whisked the martial artist alone out of the country, leaving his original sponsor behind. Over time, the former number one student faded from memory, his name only to be heard in passing.</p>
<p>As luck would have it, I have met that number one student’s son. He said something along the lines of, “that guy just got a big head.” And honestly, even that’s something everybody knew.</p>
<p>You know what? It’s just getting goddamn cumbersome tip-toeing around this guy’s name. I could not give a damn about offending him or his slaves.</p>
<p>Bobby Taboada got a big head. He is not an amazing martial artist, he is a lucky one. No matter what anyone tells you about the Philippines back then, there were no deathmatches. Nobody randomly dying in the streets because of a duel. The Philippines are not a lawless country. There are laws, just as much as there are lawmen.</p>
<p>Bobby Taboada is a dishonest businessman. He teaches people a completely different style than he was taught, even though he was taught differently. He teaches his own new style of Balintawak, but the adaptations from the old style are not improvements in the slightest. If it was such a terrible climate in the Philippines at the time, and dangerous to be a martial artist, then why did they have to change it? Well the answer comes in one of Bobby’s videos- to add  “Hollywood” to it, and because the original stuff was “too dangerous.”</p>
<p>Despite that, Bobby Taboada is essentially the word of god in the FMA community.</p>
<p>But how come his students haven’t wised up, that none of them are getting even close to the glory of Taboada?</p>
<p>And the answer is- blind sensei love.</p>
<p>You see, students tend to trust their teachers in most cases, not just martial arts. We trusted in school that 1+1 is 2, and look where that got us. But grown adults still retain this, especially in the foreign atmosphere of a martial arts gym.So when sensei says that when he does this, you do that, you will do that and not anything else, because you haven’t been taught to distrust him.</p>
<p>Be careful- ask questions, and expect straightforward answers. Look at what your teacher is doing, and if it differs greatly from what you’re doing, he’s holding something back. And he has absolutely no right to.</p>      </div>

      <h4><a href="http://arnisescrimakali.tumblr.com/post/72803751167">The Old Style and the New Style</a></h4>
      <div class="entry">
      <div class="content">
<p>After I came home from Sydney, I was really bored. I hadn’t found any students to teach (and still have not) and hadn’t really gotten any practice for a while. I was getting rusty (this blog actually helps me keep a tiny bit of my edge by keeping me thinking about arnis), and I was desperate for just a tiny bit of training. So I went back to my old gym to show off (I am not a good man), and learn what kind of techniques are more prevalent in their arnis, now that I am more experienced to know what’s going on.</p>
<p>It was.. very different. Everything was still pretty much shite, and their empty hand techniques and authority over their weapon following a grab was pretty much non-existent. After we both struggled to get used to what we were doing, he comments that what I was doing was the “old style” and what he was doing was the “new style.”</p>
<p>That never really raised a flag in my mind up til now (because I’ve been struggling to add more content for a while haha)- what is the difference between the old and new styles, and why was such a big incongruency between the styles? To understand, let’s go over the differences between the styles.</p>
<p>In “Old” balintawak, there is a shorter training time (1-2 years), in which you learn attack and defense simultaneously, train active hands, and you learn most of the martial art in a systematically grouped method. However, in “New” balintawak, there is an indeterminate training time, which could take as little as 5 years, and up to <em>never.  </em>The student is taught how to defend in the beginning of his or her training, and progression to attack is very, very slow. Students are not taught how to retain control over their weapon hand, nor how to impede the movements of their opponent’s weapon hand. Finally, although they teach the groups, there is one fundamental difference about the groups they teach- the key concepts are never taught properly, which allow for zero variation of the groups themselves. Supplementing the groups which have now been delegated to a simple kata are THOUSANDS of other moves taught “At random.”</p>
<p>At random is a term describing a different method of teaching- one that’s even older than the “Old” balintawak I have been taught. Essentially, every technique is learned individually, and then practiced repetitively. For instance, if you’re learning a disarm, you would have someone strike at you badly (see: bitchmade), and you would strip them of their weapon. Do that a certain number of times, and then trade roles. Maybe after they’d show you some variations of that same move, but they wouldn’t explain WHY the move worked and WHEN to use it.</p>
<p>But why would the “New” balintawak community go back to the At Random method? It’s actually pretty simple- the grouped method is too efficient.</p>
<p>Let’s head backwards in time- to an Attorney, known as Jose Villasin. This man is a fucking genius- let’s take a moment to appreciate that. He literally invented the grouped system, and its a bloody marvel (I’ve asked like 3 different people from the UK about this article if I was allowed to use UK-ese terminology, they all ok’d me) in its own right. Not only does the student side of a group teach an extremely important concept, but the instructor side does as well. It systemizes multitudes of techniques by its characteristics, so that when faced by an unknown technique, you can simply take note of what its accomplishing, and defending against that. Not only that, but it also teaches you how to mix groups together, as no group only works on one of the core concepts. For instance, group 2 employs its own concepts up until the point where an opening is discovered to progress to group 1, or 5.</p>
<p>However, not very long after the grouped method was discovered, Villasin discovered that it was too effective. Brand new students would be finished training in no time at all, flooding the market with instructors. Rival schools could be finished learning their secrets in a year, maybe two. And so while the Balintawak club kept the grouped method, it removed the most important part for higher levels of the martial art- the teaching of the core concepts. This extended the training time because the students would take a much longer time to truly understand what they were accomplishing, and removed variation from the groups, and the variations were to be taught at-random. </p>
<p>It’s an infinite shame that the grouped method isn’t given the respect it deserves, but it’s just how it is. “Big name balintawak” has brought back “New” balintawak, and with it has come hordes of instructors that either lack the fundamental understanding that all practitioners need, or instructors that are unwilling to teach correctly.</p>      </div>

Yes, in <i>eskrima</i> both are hands are used, not only that, parts that are also more proximal to the trunk. Just like playing guitar, both hands are used and just like playing the guitar, both hands play different but congruent roles. One is doing the strumming while the other is changing the chords.

Many people try to write things about Joe Go's TatKonTou . . . and almost always they got the spelling wrong. The conventional way to transcribe it is Tat Kon Tou, not Tat Kun Tou or Tat Kun Tao. We are not saying that these people are showcasing their ignorance on the subject, but their blindness of the details. Remember folks it's <b>Tat Kon Tou</b>, even though this Hookien word is popularly written as kun, the correct way to write it, is <b>kon</b>. And it is not tao but <b>tou</b>.

      <h4 lang="en-US"><a href="http://blog.tabiminabalintawak.com/leadership-in-a-performative-way">Leadership in a performative way.</a></h4>
      <div class="entry">
      <div class="content" lang="en-US">
<p style="text-align: justify;">“<strong><em>A Good Leader is A Good Follower…</em></strong>” These are the words that I value most during my training in the Police Academy. And in my training with the Tabimina System I’ve come to encounter this principle in a performative way.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In the Tabimina System, one must undergo the Healing Stage. It is a must for all practitioners it is where we begin to open new discoveries of our selves under stress. As what Sir Bob would say “Who are you under Stress?”. Next is the Sharpening stage, it is the refinement of skills that are being tested beyond our comfort zone and the question Sir Bob would ask you is  “Are you compose under stress?”. Then as the practitioner improves he/she will begin to train to feed.<span id="more-236"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Feeding is the avenue where one will discover himself gradually. It is also the key in the understanding the Tabimina System. It is a journey to self discovery. Feeding is the performative way of leading. I began to understand this when i started to Feed. Allow me to pick some views on the book I read written by John C Maxwell about leadership and here it goes:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>“The ability to lead is really the collection of skills, nearly all of which can be learned and improved. But if you want lasting improvement then you must undergo the process. In the process it implies the statement  “For as long as a person doesn’t know what he doesn’t know, he isn’t going to grow.””</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In this year’s gathering, Sir Bob emphasizes on the two attributes of the feeder. These are the Physical Attributes and the Internal Attributes. The Physical attributes involves the feeder’s physical fitness as well as his skills attained as a feeder and The Internal attributes involves the character of the feeder these encompasses Humility, Obedience, Sacrifice, Patience, and Dedication. Both attributes must level up simultaneously.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">My Ciong, before we became feeders we were receivers. And that is the solid foundation of Tabimina System. We must not forget that before we became leaders we were followers. Humility and Patience are one of the virtues we must learn in feeding and so does discipline and obedience  because if we don’t attain these we don’t grow as a feeder. We have to play our role during practice. We are not only feeders but receivers as well.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Everyone has the potential of being a feeder, but it isn’t accomplished overnight. It requires perseverance. It doesn’t develop overnight. It takes a lifetime.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Feeding and Leading have one of the same ingredient and that is SERVICE. Allow me to share some thoughts about Service.  What is Service? Go through such pain and suffering without complaining.  Serve the lowliest and the poorest without counting the cost nor asking any in return. Learn to appreciate the beauty of the common things around you. Glad to be alive but not afraid to die.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">And there is a saying that states ” If we wish to be great then we must be a servant of all.” Serving others who follow you really purifies your motives and helps you gain perspective. It  also brings to the surface any impure motives of the followers.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong>Great Leadership means Great Service. Great Service means Great Sacrifice</strong></em>. If we want to be feeders then start serving others. Continue Feeding and Continue Serving. As what our Great Feeder (I am referring to Sir Bob) would say “I am your servant.” Let’s Feed, Let’s serve. Let’s Lead.…</p>

<p>Today it was an honor that I was invited and got to witness UFMAC recognizing Grand Master Carlito Bonjoc, long time friend of Maestro <a href="https://www.facebook.com/pages/Sonny-Umpad/137655292921737?group_id=39748887425">Sonny Umpad</a> ! Congrats GM Carlito!</p>
<p>Grand Master Robert Castro also introduced me to all the Grand Masters as one of the lineage holders of Maestro Sonny’s curriculum and promoter of the FMA. I was grateful to be in the room with all the greats of the FMA and honor them as my elders and for paving the path for martial artists like myself to thrive in and share the arts to the world. </p>

<p>UFMAC, is an organization formed by a panel of current Grand Masters from different martial arts systems and their mission is to provide an open forum for the preservation, promotion and unification of the Filipino Martial Arts community. I will share more about this experience and some of my personal take aways soon. I definately wanted to get these images out to show that our culture and our arts are thriving but stay tuned for the specifics of the story. Congratulations again to UFMAC for being organized to promote the culture and our teachers as well as to GM Carlito for all his contributions and hard work! </p>

<p>This brawl video shows some good self defence lessons. Chest pushing -&gt; wild punching -&gt; shirt,hair,standup grappling -&gt; ground grappling ie Muay Thai -&gt; Wrestling -&gt; BJJ. But that you don’t want to get stuck grappling – someone else can then come and punch/kick you in the head…</p>
<p>Lot’s of people were hurt, but imagine if improvised weapons (beer bottles, bricks) had been used – even worse… :-( And like most fights, any of them could have just “counted to 10″ and walked away – always the best approach :-)</p>

<p><span class="embed-youtube" style="text-align: center; display: block;"></span>It’s been a while but I’m back on track after nursing two frustrating injuries back to ‘working’ order.  I’m not 100% yet, but at least I can do some things.</p>
<p>The lemonade I made from this big bag of sour lemons was spending time thinking about how to train in a way that will:</p>
<p>1.  Allow my body to heal while I’m attempting to avoid getting fat, dumb, and lazy.</p>
<p>2.  Maintain some level of performance/skill during recovery/healing.</p>
<p>3. Aid healing/recovery with a little activity.</p>
<p>Believe me when I say my usual tendency is to dive in and tough out the recover, but at 43… my body isn’t as springy as my mind thinks it is so I have to adhere to my own “Train Smart” motto to avoid taking two steps back in the recovery area.</p>
<p>SO… How do I get the most bang out of shortened <a class="zem_slink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_exercise" rel="wikipedia" target="_blank" title="Physical exercise">workouts</a>?</p>
<p>INTEGRATION!   Blending fitness conditioning with performance conditioning so I can do maintenance in both areas with shorter workouts.  Shorter workouts mean less risk of breaking myself again and integrating fitness and performance training means changing motions more frequently and reducing breaking myself through repetitive motions.</p>
<p>I haven’t reinvented the wheel by doing this by any stretch, but it was a good lesson to take out of this injury.  Thinking ‘tactically’ about my workout routines in order to accomplish a clearly defined goal (stay fit, heal, avoid re-injury) was more important than just following a routine or ‘system.’</p>
<p>I had to rethink what it meant to ‘train smart’ in this case.</p>
<p>Here is the full routine that is highlighted in the video:</p>
<ul>
<li>WARM UP</li>
<li>100 rope swings (single and double)</li>
<li>10 front steps/rope swings</li>
<li>10 back step/rope swings</li>
<li>10 forward ‘triangle’ steps/rope swings</li>
<li>10 backward ‘triangle’ steps/rope swings</li>
<li>10 sidestep/cat stance/rope swings</li>
<li>WORK</li>
<li>100 double foot skips</li>
<li>100 running skips</li>
<li>100 ‘Ali shuffle’ skips</li>
<li>REST SWINGS</li>
<li>Repeat the footwork/swings again</li>
<li>*repeat the WORK/REST cycle for 3 rounds*</li>
</ul>

<p>Obviously I am partial to all things USMC (Once a Marine… ) but in this case it is also a good example of the difference between</p>
<p>training instructors vs. training ‘martial artists.’</p>
<p>This is a short (and obviously promotional) video on the Instructor Training Program at Quantico, Virginia for the MCMAP (Marine Corps Martial Arts Program).  These ARE NOT ‘martial arts’ students.  They ARE instructor trainees.</p>
<p>What’s the difference?</p>
<p>The focus is not primarily on technical skill, it is on how to teach these skills.  Notice too that there is strong emphasis on role modeling (teaching by example) from personal behavior and historical examples.</p>
<p>Most recreational martial artists are really teachers first and practitioners second.  But, how much ‘teacher training’ have they received or sought on their own?</p>
<p>You can’t teach well if you don’t know what you are teaching, true.  But how many of our fellow ‘martial artists’ (who really are teachers of martial arts) have not spent even half as much time on learning to instruct/coach/mentor as they have on perfecting their technical skill?</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong>“Imitate me as I Imitate Anciong.”</strong></em> These are the words that Sir Bob said to me in one of the trainings I attended. I started training Tabimina Balintawak since summer of 2006, from then on things became different. From the outlook in life, awareness of the surrounding, enhanced senses, sharpened reflexes, and many more. It is a continuous and endless learning.…There is always something new…<span id="more-223"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">And then, I was caught up in a race which I thought it was. A race wherein I was tempted &amp; I quote “Tempted” to become a better and fiercer fighter. I was tempted to be as Forceful as Master Dag, Swift as Master Flint, Intimidating as Master Chad, Cunning as Sir Jojo, and Great as GM Sir Bob. In short, I was starving for power, pride, and respect until I left myself unchecked that led me crossing the line &amp; disregarding the chain of command. But thanks to Sir Bob for correcting me and leading me away from those temptations &amp; showing me my true path. The timing was perfect.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Third Gathering of Tabimina Balintawak was an another eye opener for me. A Literally Wide-Eye opener. Why? Because I saw my oldself on both the receivers and some of the feeders who are caught up in a race. And at the back of my mind i was smiling. Brothers and sisters of TB Family, there is no race. Don’t get caught up with it because it doesn’t exist. There will always be greater and better than you are.…and also lesser than you are.…</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The 3rd Gathering’s theme was UNITY but there are some who are caught up with that non-existing race which divides the family. I repeat THERE IS NO RACE of who is the best or who is better but there is a ROAD to self-discovery. My Brothers &amp; Sisters let’s harness our UNITY with HUMILITY. Let’s help each other and build up each other not only as an International Organization but also as a FAMILY because that is Tabimina Balintawak is all about.…FAMILY.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">And lastly.….let’s Imitate Sir Bob as He imitated GGM Anciong. Allow me to expound it. We just have to Imitate Sir Bob and not BE LIKE Sir Bob because there is only ONE Sir Bob.…</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There is No Race .….only a Journey to the road to Self-Discovery.…Keep on Playing with those who Imitate Sir Bob…</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>HAPPY BIRTHDAY SIR BOB</strong>.….</p>      </div>

<p style="text-align: justify;">In part one of this essay, we had established that each encounter is situational and that one of the biggest challenges to proper execution of any move in the martial arts is to pull it off accurately in real time. Attributes like timing, speed, balance, range, strength, body movement and angles of attack are universal and are used to achieve different effects in different arts. The key is taking these attributes and harnessing them via an effective system to train a student to develop productive and positive skills. The aim of every system should be to enable students to develop appropriate responses and learn to execute moves in real time. Easier said than done.<span id="more-200"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In part two of this essay, I shall discuss what I believe are traits and characteristics of effective martial arts and teaching systems and how Tabimina Balintawak exhibits these traits. Much has already been written about how the system works and training progresses so I will only be highlighting certain aspects of the training. During the course of this essay, I will make references to practices I have observed in other arts. Please note that I do not mean to discredit any art nor do I mean any disrespect. Rather I seek to use a wider base of examples so that learning and discussion can be more meaningful. I would invite all readers to keep an open mind and give this essay a fair reading before making judgment. Now that all the formalities are out of the way, let us begin our discussion in earnest about what works in a martial art.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>1. Attacks must be random and dynamic</strong><br />
Here is a hard truth: many martial arts and martial artists do not train for the “what ifs”. What if my opponent moves or blocks? What if I miss? What if he does not go down? What if my disarm goes awry? Many systems have students practice using compliant opponents i.e. students allow themselves to be used as dummies in order to for their partner to practice and learn. For example, to practice a throw, one student may allow another student to move in and execute a throw without resisting. The attacker gets to practice his throw and the defender gets to practice protecting himself when being thrown. (Guess who has more fun.) Many weapon arts also have one attacker strike and then “freeze” so the defender can practice a block and execute a counter-attack. This can be followed by more strikes, disarms and/or a takedown. It may be hard to make out but this “freezing” does take place quite a bit. At higher levels the “freeze” may be very minute because advanced students move faster and can take advantage of this gap but it is still there.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Right now many are probably going to say, “Hang on! Isn’t that the whole point of training? To get so fast that we can recognize opportunities to attack and execute our moves?” I agree completely but I am of the view that this kind of training is incomplete. Before the flaming begins, please note that in and of itself, there is absolutely nothing wrong with this freezing. Sometimes, this is needed to allow a student to practice and achieve a greater degree of finesse. However, if this is the only way to practice, then something is lacking because everything is still cognitive and ultimately students are trained using memory and anticipation which is completely different from reaction. Both sides know their roles (i.e. who is attacking and who is defending) and what is coming (i.e. who is going to end up on the ground). So the outcome has more or less been determined. This is why there is a lack of randomness and few are trained for the “what ifs”. What if a student is non-compliant and resists? What if I don’t want to be disarmed and keep up my attacks? What if my partner panics and swings wildly at me? Can all of us effectively handle a non-compliant partner?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Tabimina Balintawak, on the other hand, is completely random. From day one (and this is typical for any new student), we spend about 15–30 minutes on the 12 basic strikes and counters and from there it is all random. There is no set way in which the feeder or attacker will come at us and where, when or how he will strike next. As the training progresses, the student or defender learns a greater variety of moves and counterattacks so his repertoire is widened and the attacker himself cannot always predict how the defender will counter-attack. At the highest levels, the distinction between attacker and defender is blurred since all moves are non-choreographed and both sides have no clue anticipation what is coming next. It is completely situational and both must react based on what happens at that point in time. Who gets hit, disarmed and/or thrown off balance is really up in the air. By engaging in the process of agak (or play as we love to call it), we are training for all the “what ifs” because we actually execute them and test ourselves and our opponents. If we never train for the “what ifs” then we can never discover the truth of what happens for ourselves.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>2. There must be a strong element of defense</strong><br />
Looking at the human race, it amazes me how we have made it this far. From birth, we are completely defenseless and totally reliant on a caregiver for the first few years of our lives. Animals have to learn to move by themselves within hours of being born or risk being eaten. We learn to walk after a year or so. Some animals are immediately left on their own the moment they are born but manage to survive. Granted we have a fantastic brain which does make up for it in later years (although some people I have met make me want to believe otherwise), we are completely vulnerable for the first part of our lives. When provoked, we can instinctively lash out by punching, kicking, slapping, biting, pulling and shoving. However, we do not seem to have any instinctive defense against punching, kicking, slapping, biting, pulling and shoving. Animals, on the other hand, have survival mechanisms and are not defenseless. When chasing a zebra, lions have to be extremely careful of their prey’s powerful hind legs for a kick can seriously hurt them. I am pretty sure zebras do not sign up for classes to learn how to kick.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This leads me to ask what defense mechanisms do we instinctively have? For the life of me I cannot think of any other than running or hitting back and even the latter does not seem effective against a skilled or armed opponent. This strongly suggests to me that as human beings, we have lost our defensive capabilities and must re-learn them. Too many arts focus on strikes but pay little attention to defense; believing that “the best defense is a good offense.” I believe that the best defense is a good defense. Before the objections come flooding in, I would also like readers to consider the previous point above about randomness in attacks. If one can successfully fend off truly random attacks then one has a strong defense.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Right from the outset, Tabimina Balintawak focuses on developing a strong defense as our most fundamental tenet. Again, attacks are random and students are trained to react appropriately. It is through such practice that students develop their own sense of timing and good body mechanics. The key to strong defense in Balintawak is good body movement — not the weapon. If our defense is completely dependent on our weapon, then we are virtually naked without it. On the other hand, our body is our greatest weapon and ultimately that is what we are training; the stick is only a training tool for the body and this ensures that we are never truly defenseless. We have a saying when we play: “My defense is my problem. Your defense is your problem.” So in short, there cannot be a truly strong defense without genuinely random attacks.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>3. There must be stress</strong><br />
Many arts allow for students to practice when there is little stress. The result is that many are unprepared for the adrenaline dump that kicks in during high-stress situations like sparring, fighting and ambushes. Many may now ask, “Isn’t the whole point of sparring to get students to put everything together and practice their attack and defense?” I would answer “yes” and “no” to that question. “Yes” because sparring is supposed to do that but “no” because it does not always managed to do so.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I have come to learn that true skills can only be installed and accessed under stress. When we are under stress in an adrenal situation, when we are tired, fatigued and desperate, our body will react the way it knows best and this is when we show who and what we really are. Think about it – if one normally train and practice under safe and sanitized environment, and everything he does are systematic and planned? What would likely be his instinctive response when fists are flying and $#!* hits the fan, fine motor skills or wild haymakers?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">However, all is not lost. Some people do learn to deal with it over time and get better with more sparring. They get more confident and more adept. But that still leaves us with 2 common problems.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Firstly, what about those who give up because they do not want all that sparring? Let’s face it — sparring often hurts. At some point or other, we have to ask ourselves if all this sparring is worth it if we get more banged up from it than from actual fights and ambushes. The easy option is to give up. Some may say, “Too bad. He’s weak and can’t hack it.” I disagree with this response and shall explain why shortly.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The second problem is that no matter what, sparring will have 3 R’s present that can limit an art’s true effectiveness: Rounds, Rules and Referees. These 3 things will ensure that at the end of the day, no one gets hurt too badly and everyone lives to spar another day. For those who still believe their arts’ sparring is effective in all scenarios, I would like to invite you to do a Google search on “London Prize Fighting”. Not to take away anything from anyone but the things these men did to one another were so brutal that it would make many professional fighters today consider a career change if they were asked to fight like that.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Tabimina Balintawak offers a solution to both problems. All attacks used in this system are on the right spot and students are taught to defend accordingly. We emphasize accuracy of strikes and accurate defense. What is the difference between this and close-quarters point-sparring? 2 things — range and stress. Because Tabimina Balintawak is so close, there is a real sense of danger that is presented to the student at all times. It is the job of the feeder to constantly challenge the student by pushing him to the brink of jeopardy and then getting him to move and react to defend himself. The result is that students are never truly comfortable and it is under these stress-filled conditions that skills are imparted and installed. Also, there is progressive stress. As the student progresses, the attacks come faster, harder and are far more difficult to counter. This ensures that students are constantly challenged. So what you will see from the outside is sticks flying and bodies moving with no damage or injuries to either party. This solves the problems of discouraged and damaged students.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>4. There must be continual learning</strong><br />
In general, I do not like belts, ranks, grades, titles or certificates within the martial arts. The reason is because I feel it is too easy to get comfortable. Our instincts teach us to seek pleasure and avoid pain. Having the entire class stop what they are doing and greet you when you walk in is very flattering. Being called “Master” wherever you go is very pleasing. Walking around with a black belt is something many are proud of. Again, in and of themselves, there is nothing wrong with any of this. The problem comes when this stops us from learning anymore because we think we have “arrived”. In reference to my friend Josh Walker’s earlier article, we think we have learned all there is to learn and stop getting “IT” anymore because it is too easy to stop learning and just enjoy the position we are in. To me, all of these accolades are mental traps and must be handled carefully. That is why the only belt I care about is the one that holds my pants up.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In Tabimina Balintawak, there are no belts or ranks. In order to understand where we are and who we are up against, we simply play. It is a performative art. We seek to be able to perform under stress so belts hold little meaning for us. Learning should be ongoing and limitless. From discussions with my Balintawak instructors, we have all come to agree that learning is endless. Even the most adept at the art are constantly learning new things about themselves, new things about their students, problems they had not previously encountered or new solutions to old problems. As cliché as this may sound, it really is a journey and not a destination. There must be growth and evolution.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">On a personal level, I have come to see that the finishing line keeps moving further and further away from me. I know I am progressing but with each step forward, I realize that there is so much more to learn. I now believe I will never learn all there is to learn but I sure am going to enjoy trying. On a larger level, many arts I see are facing a difficult choice — change and adapt to today’s context or maintain their course in line with tradition and purity. There is nothing wrong with either choice and I have no views about it either way but I do have 2 concerns.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">My first concern is when instructors from arts with a long tradition and lineage insist that everything they have to teach is still applicable and useful in today’s context. Remember that many arts were developed for specific contexts in mind and these contexts may not be the same today. It is thus vital to be clear exactly what we are training for — combat, fighting, self-defense, sport, competition, performance or health — because the teachings and objectives are not the same all across the board. My second concern is with arts that insist they have all the answers and have no need to grow and learn. I think it would be useful to be truly honest about the limitations (where applicable) of every art. Consider the situations we find ourselves in everyday — the clothes we wear, the places we frequent, the people we associate with and the things we carry with us. Is this commensurate with the things we do in the context of our training?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I must acknowledge that all these ideas are not entirely my own but I do hold them to be true. They have come from a combination of my past observations, discussions with friends and experts, research from books and the Internet and teachings from my instructors. Isaac Newton put it best when he said, “If I have seen a little further, it is because I have stood on the shoulders of giants.” Credit must be given to those to have worked long and hard to seek and understand these truths and who have dedicated their time to sharing it with others. Again, I am not claiming that Tabimina Balintawak is the “most effective”, “the deadliest” or “the best” — only that it works. I would like to invite all readers to examine and reflect upon their own training and systems in light of the criteria above. Does your training involve all or only some of these traits? If your training involves all these traits, then congratulations — you are learning something wonderful and genuine and I encourage you to apply yourself to it wholeheartedly. To those who may feel that something is missing, I encourage you to examine exactly what is missing and to seek to understand what really works and what does not. At the end of the day, we are all responsible for for our own education. If we are not progressing at the pace we should be, then I think it is necessary to examine why. I do not expect all readers to agree with everything that I have put forth but I do hope that I have helped to shed a little light on a subject which so many people feel so passionately about. To round off, if there is only one thing I could share with you, it would be this:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Train the way you fight and fight the way you train.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Stay safe and keep playing!</p>

<p><a href="http://www.martialwhat.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/DSCN0697R.jpg"><img alt="Escrima Concepts Seminar September 2011" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-402" height="225" src="http://www.martialwhat.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/DSCN0697R-300x225.jpg" title="(L to R) Andrea, Massimo, Georgios, Master Steve Tappin, Col, Scott and Wayne" width="300" /></a>I was kind of surprised to notice that about 3 years have gone by since my first encounter with Master Steve Tappin, the founder of the <a href="http://www.escrimaconcepts.com/" target="_blank">Escrima Concepts</a> style, a complete fighting system that teaches weapon based attack and defences to start with and the explores what happens when you have no weapon available.</p>
<p>One of  my main purpose of attending a martial arts seminar is to have the opportunity of learning, usually new things, from a master or instructor that is usually not available for local tuitions, and share with a few others his/her expertise in a session that is normally longer that the average class. However last Sunday I was particularly lucky; I attended, together with 3 other <a href="http://www.carisma.org.uk/" target="_blank">CARISMA</a> members, a seminar organised by my friends at the <a href="http://www.cambridgekungfu.com/" target="_blank">Cambridge Kung Fu</a> and I was pleased to find out that just 13 people, including us, were taking part to the event.  The real luck was having Master Tappin in person taking care directly of us for a generous amount of time and really ensuring we would get a great training.</p>
<p>Master Tappin’s teaching style is very clear and effective and he always manages to simply explain the essence of why one thing should be done in a certain way and shows it directly, helped by his expert son Wayne.  It’s shocking to see a man who had a broken back and an injured knee, somebody who struggles to stand and limps visibly but then, when demonstrating a technique, moves with the speed and the grace of the great martial artist he really is.</p>
<p>Weapons are tricky to handle and they open a complete new dimension about what should and should not be done while fighting.  While I don’t feel my skill level has grown substantially I can acknowledge I learnt a lot of useful concepts and by repeating and rehearsing the moves my skill will improve over time.</p>
<p>Whether you have experience in weapon based training or, like me, passionate and curious about exploring a new art I would definitely suggest to join one of Master Tappin’s seminar at your earliest convenience.</p>

      <h4><a href="http://balintawakarnisgoldcdeo.blogspot.com/2010/05/twelve-basic-strikes-of-balintawak.html">The Twelve Basic Strikes of Balintawak Style Arnis</a></h4>
      <div class="entry">
      <div class="content">
Traditionally the 12 strikes are taught by having one partner stand in front of you while holding both ends of his stick with both arms relaxed and down. The other partner shall then proceed to execute the 12 strikes in proper sequence from numbers 1 through 12. It is done at the beginning of the training session. The partners may or may not switch roles at their discretion. <br /><br />The 12 basic strikes of the Balintawak system of arnis are as follows:<br /><br />1 - a downward diagonal forehand swing to the left side of the head.<br />2 - a downward diagonal backhand swing to the right side of the head.<br />3 - a downward diagonal backhand swing to the right side of the torso.<br />4 - a downward diagonal forehand swing to the left side of the torso.<br />5 - a straight forehand thrust to the abdomen.<br />6 - a straight backhand thrust to the right shoulder.<br />7 - a straight forehand thrust to the left shoulder.<br />8 - a downward diagonal forehand swing to the left knee.<br />9 - a downward diagonal backhand swing to the right knee.<br />10 - a straight backhand thrust to the right side of the head.<br />11 - a straight forehand thrust to the left side of the head.<br />12 - a straight downward overhead swing to the forehead.<br /><br />Sadly though, some teachers only glaze through this part of the training, or (much worse) do not even fully understand how the abecedario is relative with the more advanced kuridas and cuentada training of the system.<br /><br />Thinking that the 12 "basic strikes" are just plainly basic when asked about it is an understatement. The basic strikes may seem like plain old strikes when beginning your training with it, however with the introduction of tiny variations and new concepts the 12 basic strikes training takes on a whole deeper meaning in terms of the depth and richness of techniques found within it.<br /><br />There are techniques for trapping (Pang Trangka) and off balancing, even triangle footwork and evasion if you look hard enough and are creative enough in looking for these little bits and pieces. Once you start finding these little bits and pieces, your training will become a whole lot more fun and interesting.<br /><br />Until next time my fellow Arnis, Kali, and Eskrima practitioners...<br /><br />TRAIN HARD, TRAIN SMART, AND TRAIN SAFE!      </div>

<p>I bumped into these videos and I decided to create this post for a few simple reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>The drills are well explained starting from the correct posture and stance all the way to their complete execution;</li>
<li>The performer continuously refers to boxing techniques and shows how the weapon attack can always be adapted to the bare hand strikes;</li>
<li>Using Eskrima/Kali sticks is a great workout even if you are practicing other martial arts.</li>
</ul>
<p>The only little problem is the low quality of the audio and the interference from various vehicles passing by.</p>
<p>Enjoy!</p>

      <div class="entry">
      <div class="content" lang="en-US">
<p>I was recently invited by my friends at <a href="http://www.cambridgekungfu.com/" target="_blank" title="Cambridge Kung Fu">Cambridge Kung Fu</a> to an “<a href="http://www.escrimaconcepts.com/">Escrima concepts</a>” seminar run by master <strong>Steve Tappin</strong>.   Escrima is a martial art originated in the Philippines and it’s predominantly a weapon based system that teaches fighting by using sticks, machetes, knifes and daggers in various combinations of one of two weapons handled at once.  The same concepts, moves and drills are applied regardless of the weapon used by the practitioner or his opponent in order to develop automatic reflexes that would work in any situation, at least in theory.   If you heard of Kali, Arnis, Doce Pares or Cadena de Mano they are all similar styles: in fact I was told by an instructors that in the Philippines there are literally hundreds of different flavours of this styles, some of which are kept secret and developed among single families.</p>
<p>I heard great things from different sources about master Tappin’s skills: he is one of the (if not the) biggest experts of weapon based martial arts in the UK, with a large number of followers around the world and his seminars are always fully booked.  This was an opportunity not to be missed, in order to improve my limited experience of weapon handling that is mostly limited to nunchakus, katana and sai, weapons used by  Okinawan styles.   When I first saw him I could not believe to my eyes: master Tappin is a large stocky men in his fifties that looks more like a large door security person rather than a martial artist as I was used to think of one until that day.  In any case, within a few minutes into the seminar it was obvious that appearance is some time misleading.</p>
<p>The first exercise we were asked to perform was to face, armed with one stick, an opponent with two: the concept was to attack first, one stick at the time, to create space and allow getting close to the opponent and eventually disarming him.  We then carried on working in various possible scenarios of one person with two, one or no stick facing another that as well can be armed or bear handed.  All concepts explained were amazingly interesting as they could always be transferred across without thinking in what situation our opponent was attacking us.  Master Tappin, with his 36 years experience of weapon handling, pointed out and repeated many time that when you are facing a weapon the correct technique makes the difference between walking out of that situation and being killed.  A stick or a bottle can break your skull while a knife or a machete can seriously injure you or kill you: the quality of the concepts and the techniques practiced is vital.</p>
<p>It is obvious that a four hours seminar cannot teach stick fighting or defence against weapons: in fact I believe that fighting against a weapon cannot be guaranteed safe in any situation even after years of training.  At the same time I was impressed by how many important concepts can be learnt in such a short time and by how many things can be overlooked unless you are taught by a real expert.</p>
